Project hosted live here: https://creative-cucurucho-178d47.netlify.app/

Just a quick little project hacked together in 2 hours to show what a potential dedicated live-streaming channel(alongside the current text/voice channels) functionality within discord could look like. A sleeker chat experience along with a live stream running on top, similar to Twitch but within Discord.
